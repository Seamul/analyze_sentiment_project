# analyze_sentiment_project

## Django Project

This is a Django project for sentiment analysis. It aims to analyze the sentiment of textual data using natural language processing techniques.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Seamul/analyze_sentiment_project.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```shell
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:

     ```shell
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS/Linux:

     ```shell
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install project dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Database Setup

1. Apply database migrations:

   ```shell
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. (Optional) If you want to use a different database backend, update the `DATABASES` configuration in the project's `settings.py` file accordingly.

## Usage

```

The server will start running at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/). Open this URL in your web browser to access the sentiment analysis project.

## Feature: Sentiment Analysis API Endpoint

This project includes a sentiment analysis API endpoint that performs sentiment analysis on provided text.

- Endpoint: `/analyze`
- HTTP Method: `POST`
- Request Payload: JSON object with the following structure:
  ```json
  {
    "text": "Text to be analyzed"
  }
  ```

  {
    "sentiment": "positive/negative/neutral"
  }
  ```

Additionally, a welcome message and an example usage of the API can be obtained by sending a GET request to the sentiment analysis API endpoint.

- Endpoint: `/analyze`
- HTTP Method: `GET`
