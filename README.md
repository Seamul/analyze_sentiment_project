## Model Details

This project utilizes the "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment" model for sentiment analysis. The "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment" model is a pre-trained model specifically designed for sentiment analysis tasks. Here are some potential benefits of using this model:

1. High Performance: The model has been trained on a large dataset of Twitter data, which helps it understand and capture sentiment patterns in social media text effectively. It has demonstrated strong performance in sentiment analysis tasks, achieving competitive results.

2. Contextual Understanding: The model is based on the RoBERTa architecture, which is a state-of-the-art language model. RoBERTa models have a deep understanding of contextual information in text, allowing them to capture nuances and dependencies that can influence sentiment.

3. Generalizability: The model is trained on a broad range of Twitter data, making it suitable for sentiment analysis tasks in various domains and languages. It can generalize well to different types of textual data and provide reliable sentiment predictions.

4. Easy Integration: The model is available through the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides a user-friendly API for loading and using pre-trained models. This simplifies the integration of the sentiment analysis functionality into your Django project.

5. Community Support: The model is developed and maintained by the Cardiff NLP research group, which ensures ongoing support and potential updates. The wider NLP community is also actively involved in developing and refining sentiment analysis models, contributing to their quality and reliability.

By using the "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment" model, you can leverage its pre-trained knowledge to perform sentiment analysis tasks with confidence and achieve accurate sentiment predictions for textual data, especially in the context of social media text.



## Database Setup

1. Apply database migrations:

   ```shell
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. (Optional) If you want to use a different database backend, update the `DATABASES` configuration in the project's `settings.py` file accordingly.

## Usage

To run the Django development server, execute the following command:

```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will start running at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/). Open this URL in your web browser to access the sentiment analysis project.

## Feature: Sentiment Analysis API Endpoint

This project includes a sentiment analysis API endpoint that performs sentiment analysis on provided text.

- Endpoint: `/analyze`
- HTTP Method: `POST`
- Request Payload: JSON object with the following structure:
  ```json
  {
    "text": "Text to be analyzed"
  }
  ```
- Response: JSON response with the following structure:
  ```json
  {
    "sentiment": "positive/negative/neutral"
  }
  ```

Additionally, a welcome message and an example usage of the API can be obtained by sending a GET request to the sentiment analysis API endpoint.

- Endpoint: `/analyze`
- HTTP Method: `GET`
- Response: JSON response containing a welcome message and an example usage of the API.

```
Handles GET requests to the sentiment analysis API endpoint.

Returns:
    Response: JSON response containing a welcome message and an example usage of the API.
```

Please note that the "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment" model is used for sentiment analysis, and it will be automatically loaded during the execution of the sentiment analysis endpoint.
